ASSESSMENT PASSAGES — Research-Backed Reading Material for Stutter Detection
==============================================================================
Based on clinical speech pathology research (Johnson & Brown 1935, Hahn 1942,
NIH publications) on the most commonly stuttered speech sounds.

KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS:
- Plosives (B, P, T, D, K, G) are stuttered MOST — air pressure buildup causes blocks
- Fricatives (S, SH, F, TH, V, Z) cause prolongations (stretching sounds)
- Consonant clusters (STR, SP, SK, BL, FL, GR) require complex motor coordination
- Liquids/Glides (R, L, W) cause difficult transitions
- Stuttering occurs 3–4× more on consonants than vowels
- Word-initial positions are stuttered MOST
- Content words (nouns, verbs) > function words in adults
- Longer words and sentence-initial words trigger more stuttering

PASSAGE DESIGN:
Each passage is carefully constructed to contain a high density of specific
target sounds in word-initial positions, using natural sentence structures.
